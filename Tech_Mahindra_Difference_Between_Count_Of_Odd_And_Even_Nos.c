/*
Write a program to return the difference between the count of odd numbers and even
numbers.
Note : You are expected to write code in the countOddEvenDifference function only 
which will receive the first parameter as the number of items in the array and 
second parameter as the array itself. you are not required to take input from the 
console.
Example
Finding the difference between the count of odd and even numbers from a list of 5  
number
Input
input 1 : 8
input 2 : 10 20 30 40 55 66 77 83
Output
-2
Explanation
The first paramter (8) is the szie of the array. Next is an array of integers. The 
calculation of difference between count sum of odd and even numbers is as follows:
3 (count of odd numbers) â€“ 5 (count of even numbers) = -2
*/
#include<stdio.h>
int countOddEvenDifference(int n,int arr[]){
    int odd=0,even=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(arr[i]%2==0){
            even=even+1;
        }
        else{
            odd=odd+1;
        }
    }
    return odd-even;
}
int main(){
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int array[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        scanf("%d",&array[i]);
    }
    int result= countOddEvenDifference(n,array);
    printf("%d",result);
    return 0;
}
